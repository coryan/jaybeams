/**
 * Keep statistics about a feed and its offline processor.
 *
 * In JayBeams we will find ourselves processing all kinds of offline
 * feeds, that is, files with the contents of a real-time feed.  We
 * want to measure things like the processing time for the data, what
 * is the distribution of message rates like, what is the distribution
 * of mesage inter-arrival times like.
 *
 * This class encapsulates a lot of the logic for those computations.
 * The class can be thoroughly configured at run-time, for ease of
 * experimentation, but the default values should be reasonable.
 *
 * The source of timestamps can be an actual clock, the recorded
 * timestamps is a feed file, or some virtual clock used in
 * simulations.  The only requirement is for the timestamps to be
 * compatible with std::chrono::duration<>.  It might seem odd to use
 * std::chrono::duration<> instead of std::chrono::time_point<>, this
 * is because most feeds are timestamps to a well known time point:
 * midnight at the beginning of the day, or 00:00:00am.
 *
 * Likewise, the processing latency measurements can be generated from
 * an actual clock or some virtual measurement (say counting
 * interrupts, or CPU cycles vs. elapsed time).  The only requirement
 * is for the measurements to be compatible with
 * std::chono::duration<>.
