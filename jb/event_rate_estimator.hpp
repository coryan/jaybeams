/**
 * Estimate event rates over a trailing measurement period.
 *
 * Assume you are interested in statistics about events per
 * millisecond.  This class estimates the number of events per
 * trailing millisecond, using an arbitrary sampling period.  For
 * example, you could set the sampling period to 1 microsecond, this
 * class would then estimate the event rate over the previous
 * millisecond for every microsecond.  Or you could set the sampling
 * period to 1 millisecond, which would then estimate the event rate
 * on each millisecond.  Admittedly, for most practical purposes
 * measuring event rates over an exact millisecond boundary or over
 * a trailing millisecond has limited interest, but it was fun to
 * write this class.
 *
 * Given a @a measurement_period: the time over which we want to
 * measure event rates, and @a sampling_period: how often we want to
 * measure the event rates, the class keeps a circular buffer of N
 * counters, representing the trailing sampling periods.  N is chosen
 * such that
 *   @f$ N > {{measurement\_period} \over {sampling\_period}} @f$.
 *
 * As new events arrive the counter for the current sampling period is
 * incremented, once an event in a new sampling period is observed the
 * class emits updates (via a functor) to update the estimated event
 * rate.
 *
 * @tparam duration_t Defines class used to measure time, this
 *   class must be compatible with std::chrono::duration_type.  The
 *   class assumes that event timestamps are measured as durations
 *   with respect to some well-defined (by convention) epoch.  For
 *   example, some data feeds use timestamps as nanoseconds since
 *   midnight, while others use timestamps as microseconds since the
 *   Unix Epoch.
 * @tparam counter_t The type of the counters, most of the time a
 *   simple integer would work well, but if you need to create a large
 *   number of instances of this class, and the values are expected to
 *   be very small, you might consider using a 16-bit or even and
 *   8-bit counter.  Likewise, if you expect very large values for the
 *   counters, such as when measuring event rate per minute, you
 *   should consider using a 64-bit counter.
