/**
 * Maintain the ITCH-5.0 order book for a single security.
 *
 * ITCH-5.0, like other market data feeds provide order-by-order
 * detail, that is, the feed includes a message for each order
 * received by the exchange, as well as the changes to these 
 * orders, i.e. when the execute, when their quantity (and/or price)
 * is modified, and when they are canceled..  Such feeds are sometimes
 * called Level III feeds.  Typically only orders that do not
 * immediately execute in full are included in the feed.
 *
 * There is substantial variation in the format of the messages, and
 * some variation as to whether executions are represented differently
 * than a partial cancel, and whether changes in price are allowed or
 * create new order ids.
 *
 * This class receives a stream of (unnormalized) ITCH-5.0 messages
 * for a single security, and organizes the orders in a
 * book, i.e. a  data structure where orders at the same price are
 * grouped together, and one can quickly ask:
 *
 * - What is the best bid (highest price of BUY orders) and what is
 * the total quantity available at that price?
 * - What is the best offer (lowest price of SELL orders) and what is
 * the total quantity available at that price?
