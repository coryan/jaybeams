JayBeams does not have any releases yet, so you probably cloned the
git repository.  You should first get the dependencies for JayBeams,
detailed instructions are in the doc/setup.md document.

The ci/Dockerfile.* files are a good place to find all details on
how to install the dependencies, as the continuous integration builds
are driven from these files.

Once all dependencies are installed compilation is relatively easy:

$ mkdir build ; cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make test
$ sudo make install
